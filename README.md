# Datapad Frontend Assessment


## Introduction

Hi ðŸ‘‹

This project is created to help us to evaluate the candidates who are in application or evaluation process.

We mostly redirect candidates here during their technical assessment step. Still, you may also solve this
challenge and reach us with your application and solution attached as long as you think that you're a good
fit for our open positions listed at [datapad.io/jobs](https://datapad.io/jobs).


## Our Application Process

The entire process takes 3-7 days depending on the candidate's availability:

1. Initial Meeting Call (15m, On the Phone)
2. **Technical Evaluation** `<!-- you are here`
3. Culture-Fit Assessment (45m)
4. Proposal
